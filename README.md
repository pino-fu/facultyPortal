**Student Management Web App**

**Objective**: The objective of this take-home project is to build a small web application that enables the creation, editing, and deletion of student records.
**Requirements**:

1.	User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the application seamlessly.
2.	Create Student: Implement a feature to add new student records by capturing necessary information such as name, age, and contact details.
3.	Edit Student: Enable users to modify existing student records, including updating their information.
4.	Delete Student: Provide functionality to remove student records from the system.
5.	Data Storage: Utilize appropriate data storage mechanisms (e.g., database, file system or JSON file) to store and retrieve student records.
6.	Validation: Implement validation checks/tests to ensure that required fields are filled and data is entered in the correct format.

**Deliverables**:
1.	Source Code: Provide the complete source code of the web application, written in a suitable programming language. (Commit code into this GitHub repo)
2.	Documentation: Include clear simple instructions on how to set up and run the application locally in the empty Readme of this GitHub project.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
•	Functionality: The application should accurately create, edit, and delete student records as per the provided requirements.
•	User Interface: The user interface should be intuitive, and easy to navigate.
•	Code Quality: The source code should be well-structured, readable, and adhere to best practices of the chosen programming language.
•	Error Handling: The application should handle potential errors and edge cases gracefully, providing appropriate error messages where necessary.
•	Data Persistence: The student records should be stored persistently and retrieved correctly upon application restart.
•	Validation: UI Tests.

**Deadline**: Please complete the project within 7 days (The weekend is included) and submit the deliverables via this GitHub repository.

**Note**: Feel free to use any frameworks for the app, libraries, or technologies that you find suitable for the project. However here at Bluebook we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/app/?utm_adgroup=132501525280&utm_keyword=cypress%20installation&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=15312994475&utm_term=cypress%20installation&hsa_acc=8898574980&hsa_cam=15312994475&hsa_grp=132501525280&hsa_ad=562694869905&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-1396165241981&hsa_kw=cypress%20installation&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwx_eiBhBGEiwA15gLNxnQlCExHSau6Uikd18ScG7Ji2FjDt1PKDmQqlLjSx7UZs8tY8Ka1BoCX5gQAvD_BwE#delightful_experience) for UI Testing, and we recommend it. Ensure that you provide clear instructions on any dependencies or setup requirements.

After the submission has been reviewed, we will reach out to you about the next steps. Good luck with the project, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!
