# Faculty Portal Application

### This is a lightweight frontend CRUD application built using the React framework that simulates a student database. CRUD functionality, however, was not my main focus. 
* My main focus was to keep the users interaction with the UI, specifically forms, to be "contained" within desired parameters.
## Key Features 
* Add, edit, view and delete students
* Search for students by name or phone number
* View students by grade 
* "Today's Birthays" button allows faculty members to quickly view a list of students who's birthday it is for those classic morning announcements! 
* Red "X" appears on all text inputs when insufficiently populated, keeping the user informed of expectations
